                    Each year, 9 million American women travel overseas alone.
                    The concept of solo female travel is not new, but it is a growing trend. Statistics show that 72% of lady travelers in 2014 were enthusiastic about traveling solo and have actually traveled on their own either for work or pleasure. According to Booking.com, 59% of women solo travelers would travel alone again in the next 12 months with “a mission to be refreshed and inspired.”
